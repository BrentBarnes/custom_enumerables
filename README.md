# Ruby Custom Enumerables

Ruby comes with many handy built in methods that do much of the heavy lifting for us. In this project I recreate many of those methods so that I can understand how they work under the hood.

### Assignment From The Odin Project

"The goal of this project is to reimplement common methods used frequently through the enumerables module with objects like arrays and hashes. This project will also familiarize you with how to work with blocks and procs. Some starter code and specs are provided to validate the correctness of your solutions."

### Recreated Methods Include

* my_each
* my_each_with_index
* my_select
* my_all?
* my_any?
* my_none?
* my_count
* my_map
* my_inject
